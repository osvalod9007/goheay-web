                <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
                <p>
                  This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Mobile Application Developer ("Mobile Application
                  Developer", "we", "us" or "our") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information
                  ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide in the Goheavy mobile application
                  and any of its products or services (collectively, "Mobile Application" or "Services"). It also
                  describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can
                  access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we
                  do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
                </p>
                <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
                <p>
                  When you open the Mobile Application our servers automatically record information that your device
                  sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address and location, device name
                  and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, information you search for in
                  our Mobile Application, access times and dates, and other statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
                <p>
                  You can visit the Mobile Application without telling us who you are or revealing any information by
                  which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use
                  some of the Mobile Application's features, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information
                  (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly
                  provide to us when you create an account, publish content, or fill any online forms in the Mobile
                  Application. When required, this information may include your email address, name, phone number,
                  credit card information, or other Personal Information. You can choose not to provide us with your
                  Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Mobile
                  Application's features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to
                  contact us.
                </p>
                <h2>Managing personal information</h2>
                <p>
                  You are able to access, add to, update and delete certain Personal Information about you. The
                  information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Mobile Application or Services change.
                  When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our
                  records. Some information may remain in our private records after your deletion of such information
                  from your account. We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply
                  with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention
                  period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating
                  your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you
                  personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the
                  right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability
                  cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
                </p>
                <h2>Use of collected information</h2>
                <p>
                  Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience; improve our
                  Mobile Application; improve customer service and respond to queries and emails of our customers; send
                  notification emails such as password reminders, updates, etc; run and operate our Mobile Application
                  and Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse
                  and establish statistical information regarding Mobile Application traffic and usage. This statistical
                  information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the
                  system.
                </p>
                <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
                <p>
                  In addition to the rights as explained in this Privacy Policy, California residents who provide
                  Personal Information (as defined in the statute) to obtain products or services for personal, family,
                  or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about
                  the Personal Information we shared, if any, with other businesses for marketing uses. If applicable,
                  this information would include the categories of Personal Information and the names and addresses of
                  those businesses with which we shared such personal information for the immediately prior calendar
                  year (e.g., requests made in the current year will receive information about the prior year). To
                  obtain this information please contact us.
                </p>
                <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
                <p>
                  We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are
                  under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Mobile Application or
                  Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to
                  help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through
                  our Mobile Application or Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child
                  under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through our Mobile Application or Service,
                  please contact us. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your Personal
                  Information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your
                  behalf).
                </p>
                <h2>Links to other mobile applications</h2>
                <p>
                  Our Mobile Application contains links to other mobile applications that are not owned or controlled by
                  us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other mobile
                  applications or third-parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Mobile Application and
                  to read the privacy statements of each and every mobile application that may collect Personal
                  Information.
                </p>
                <h2>Information security</h2>
                <p>
                  We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected
                  from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and
                  physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and
                  disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the
                  Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal
                  Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which
                  are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
                  exchanged between you and our Mobile Application cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information
                  and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third-party, despite best efforts.
                </p>
                <h2>Data breach</h2>
                <p>
                  In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application has been compromised or users
                  Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
                  including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably
                  appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as
                  notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we
                  will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable
                  risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we
                  do, we will post a notice in the Mobile Application, send you an email.
                </p>
                <h2>Legal disclosure</h2>
                <p>
                  We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as
                  to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure
                  is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or
                  respond to a government request.
                </p>
                <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
                <p>
                  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in our discretion and will notify you of any
                  material changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information. When changes are made, we will
                  revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways in
                  our discretion, such as through contact information you have provided. Any updated version of this
                  Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless
                  otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Mobile Application or Services after the effective date
                  of the revised Privacy Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent
                  to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Data in a manner
                  materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Data was collected. Policy was
